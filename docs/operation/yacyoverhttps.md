# Using the YaCy Front-End over HTTPS

It is possible to put a SSL encryption in front of YaCy to get the YaCy
interface accessible using https. This can easily be done using stunnel
and openssl.

## Installation of openssl and stunnel in debian

As user root, call:

    apt-get install openssl stunnel

Then create a ssl certificate:

    cd ~
    openssl req -new -x509 -keyout stunnel-key-pw.pem -out stunnel-cert.pem -days 3650

And get rid of the passphrase with

    openssl rsa -in stunnel-key-pw.pem -out stunnel-key.pem

As user root, copy the key and certificate file to `/etc/stunnel/`

    mv stunnel-key.pem stunnel-cert.pem /etc/stunnel/
    chmod 600 /etc/stunnel/*.pem 

To configure stunnel, create the file `/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf` with the
following content:

    chroot = /var/lib/stunnel4/
    setuid = stunnel4
    setgid = stunnel4
    pid = /stunnel4.pid
    cert = /etc/stunnel/stunnel-cert.pem
    key = /etc/stunnel/stunnel-key.pem
    output = stunnel.log
    
    [https]
    accept  = 443
    connect = 8090

To activate this service, edit the file `/etc/default/stunnel4` and change
the value of `ENABLED` to `1`. Finally restart stunnel:

    /etc/init.d/stunnel4 restart

Now the YaCy search page can be opened at <https://localhost>
