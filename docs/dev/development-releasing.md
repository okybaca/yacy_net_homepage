# YaCy Development and Releasing


## Repository
Main repository for YaCy is <https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server>

For sake of simplicity, development is done in 'master' branch, there is no separate
development/experimental branch.

Version number is usually incremented with a major feature. 

As of habit, second decimal minor version number is incremented while upgrading
solr from one version to greater, such as 1.93 -> 1.94. Note that solr is
usually able to upgrade only one major version up. 

"Stable" releases are
[tagged](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/tags) with
'Release_versionnumber' tags.

[All development-related issues](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22developer%20issue%22) are tagged
in Github Issues.

In case of functionality change, please make sure you updated the
[documentation](https://yacy.net/docs/) in a separate [docs repository](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_net_homepage)
as well.


## Build

YaCy is currently built using 'ant', which takes care of all library dependencies.

Transition to Maven is [in progress](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/pull/710)
and would need help.

Historically, 'gradle' was used to build, later removed, but could be
excavated [as of here](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/167373025d20fbabafbb04cd5c226676ffe47848)
by anyone who likes to use specifically Gradle for debugging.
