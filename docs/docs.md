## Old and obsolete
The original YaCy wiki is closed now (no new registration or editing) and
will be abandoned in future, but still contains valuable information.  You
can help the community by transfering the usable information to [yacy github
documentation](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_net_homepage/) from which this
page is being generated.  [See how.](contribute.md)
